Physics problems I need to find out how to solve:
1. draw boundaries around the player so we can detect collisions
   https://github.com/viblo/pymunk/blob/master/examples/using_sprites.py
2. how to calculate force applied to ball - kicking animation is just 2 different
   images so how do I use pymunk to show how much force is being applied
3. horizontal motion? implement this last because figuring out how kicking the ball
   is more important

 Problems with multiplayer aspect:
 1. Figure out what additional functionality multiplayers grants us
 2. Basic hosting tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIPZoZheMTo
